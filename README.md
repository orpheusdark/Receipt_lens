# Receipt Lens üßæ‚ú® ‚Äì An AI-Powered Expense Tracker

Welcome to **Receipt Lens**!  
This project is a powerful, AI-driven web application that lets you scan receipts with your camera, automatically extract all the details, and save them into a structured **Google Sheet**. It's a fully-featured expense tracker built to be modern, easy to use, and completely free to run.

## My Journey üöÄ

This project has been a fantastic learning experience, full of twists, turns, and pivots.

### The Initial Dream: A Serverless AI Agent ‚òÅÔ∏è

My original ambition was to build an AI agent in the cloud. A mobile app would upload receipt images to **Google Cloud Storage**, triggering a **Cloud Function** or **Cloud Run** service. This backend would process the image using **Gemini AI**, extract data, and save it to **Google Sheets**. A perfect server-side architecture.

### The "Billing Wall" üß±

Despite completing the architecture and code, I hit a major hurdle ‚Äî **Google Cloud required billing to be enabled**, even within the free tier. My goal was zero-cost deployment without sharing payment details, so I had to rethink everything.

### The Pivot: Thinking Inside the Browser üí°

Instead of giving up, I pivoted.  
**"What if I eliminate the backend entirely?"**  
This led me to a 100% client-side solution. The browser itself would handle everything ‚Äî image capture, AI communication, and data storage ‚Äî directly via JavaScript.

### The Final Product: Receipt Lens üì±

After rounds of coding, debugging, and UI tuning, **Receipt Lens** was born ‚Äî a **single HTML file** app you can host for free (e.g., GitHub Pages). It‚Äôs a testament to the power of modern web browsers.

## How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è

This app combines several cutting-edge web technologies:

### üñºÔ∏è Frontend Magic (HTML + Tailwind CSS)

Built entirely with HTML and styled using **Tailwind CSS** for a sleek, responsive UI ‚Äî no separate CSS files needed.

### üì∏ Camera Access

Using `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia` API to securely access your device's camera to scan receipts.

### üß† The AI Brain (Gemini AI)

Captured images are converted into **Base64 strings** and sent to the **Gemini 1.5 Flash model** via REST API. A well-engineered prompt returns structured **JSON** data from the receipt.

### üìä Data Storage (Google Sheets)

The structured data is appended directly to a Google Sheet via the **Sheets API**, enabling real-time expense logging.

### ü§ñ Automation (Google Apps Script)

A small **Apps Script** runs on every update. It merges related cells (vendor, date, totals) into a clean, readable format.

### Step 2: Enable Required APIs

- **[Google Sheets API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/sheets.googleapis.com)**  
- **[Generative Language API (Gemini)](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apis)**

Click **Enable** for each.

### Step 3: Create Credentials

#### üîë Gemini API Key

- Click **"Create API key in new project"**.
- Copy and save it.

#### ü™™ OAuth 2.0 Client ID

1. Visit [Google Cloud Credentials page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).
2. Click **+ CREATE CREDENTIALS ‚Üí OAuth client ID**.
3. Select **"Web application"** and name it.
4. Under **Authorized JavaScript origins**, add:
   - `http://localhost:8000` for local use.
   - Your live site URL if deploying (e.g., `https://your-username.github.io`).
5. Click **Create**, and save the **Client ID**.

#### üßæ OAuth Consent Screen

1. Go to **OAuth consent screen** in Cloud Console.
2. Choose **External ‚Üí Create**.
3. Fill required fields (App name, support email, etc.).
4. Click **Save and Continue** through all sections.
5. Under **Test users**, add your testing Google account.

### Step 4: Set Up Google Sheet

1. Create a new Google Sheet.
2. Rename the first tab to: `Receipt`
3. Add these exact headers to Row 1:
   ```
   Photo Timestamp, Transaction ID, Vendor, Transaction Date, Transaction Time, Payment Type, Item Description, Quantity, Unit Price, Subtotal, Tax, Grand Total
   ```
4. Copy the **Spreadsheet ID** from the URL and save it.

### Step 5: Add Auto-Merging Script

1. In the Sheet, go to **Extensions ‚Üí Apps Script**.
2. Delete any code in `Code.gs`.
3. Paste code from the `apps-script.js` file in this repo.
4. Save the project.

### Step 6: Configure and Run the Web App

1. Download the `index.html` file from this repo.
2. Open in a text editor.
3. Inside the `<script>` tag, set:
   ```js
   const CLIENT_ID = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID";
   const GEMINI_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY";
   const SPREADSHEET_ID = "YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID";
   ```
4. Save the file.
5. To run locally:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
6. Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.
